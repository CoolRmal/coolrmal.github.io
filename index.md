Hello, this is Aaron Lin. I am currently a math concentrator at Brown University, and my main interests are harmonic analysis, PDEs, and HoTT. I share my experiences of learning math here. I often find the proofs in textbooks difficult to understand, so I hope to share some of my own understanding of mathematics and provide some motivation for various concepts. If you like my content or have any questions related to math, feel free to contact me via email. 

I am also a user of <a href="https://www.zhihu.com/people/aaron-lin-33">Zhihu</a> (a Chinese version of Quora) and I answer questions about math on this platform.
