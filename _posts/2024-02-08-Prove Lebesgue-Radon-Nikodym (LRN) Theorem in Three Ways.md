# Prove Lebesgue-Radon-Nikodym (LRN) Theorem in Three Ways

> "Most mathematicians prove what they can, von Neumann proves what he wants."

Theorem (LRN): Let $\nu,\mu$ be finite positive measures on a measure space $(X,\mathcal{M})$. There exists positive measures  on  and an integrable function  such that

This is actually a simplified version. However, it is easy to prove uniqueness of this decomposition and generalize to the case of finite signed measures or complex measures once we can prove Theorem 1. I'll present three different mathematical ideas related to the existence of this decomposition in the case of finite positive measures.
