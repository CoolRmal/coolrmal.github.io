# Prove Lebesgue-Radon-Nikodym (LRN) Theorem in Three Ways

> "Most mathematicians prove what they can, von Neumann proves what he wants."

Theorem 1 (LRN): Let $\nu,\mu$ be finite positive measures on a measure space $(X,\mathcal{M})$. There exists positive measures $\lambda,\rho$ on $(X,\mathcal{M})$ and an integrable function $f:X\rightarrow [0,\infty]$ such that

$$\lambda \perp \mu, \rho \ll \mu, \nu=\lambda+\rho, d \rho=f d \mu$$

This is actually a simplified version. However, the uniqueness of this decomposition and generalization to the case of finite signed measures or complex measures are easy. Therefore, I'll mainly focus on Theorem 1 and present three different mathematical ideas related to the existence of this decomposition in this article.

## Measure Theoretic Viewpoint
