## Solutions to the Final Exam for MATH2510: Algebra, Fall 2024, Brown University

<strong>Problem 1.</strong> Let $D_{2n}$ be the symmetry group of an $n-$gon and $S_n$ be the permutation group of $n$ elements. Determine whether the following two statements are true:
- $D_{12}\cong D_6\times S_2$
- $D_{16}\cong D_8\times S_2$

<em>Proof: </em> We present here only a geometric argument for the first statement. $D_{12}$ is not only the symmetry group of a hexagon but also the one of a hexagram, which can be decomposed into two triangles. The figure below shows two elements of $D_{12}$. The first row shows how you can identity the 60 degree rotation of a triangle with the 120 degree rotation of the hexagram. The second row shows how you can identity the transposition in $S_2$ with a reflection of the hexagram.

$D_{16}$ is not isomorphic to $D_8\times S_2$ because the first group contains an element of order 8 and the degree of every element in the second group is less than or equal to 4. $\square$

<strong>Problem 2.</strong> Let $G=\text{SL}_2(\mathbb{F}_3)$ and $H\subset G$ be the group of upper triangular matrices with all ones on the diagonal. Show that $H$ is a Sylow 3-subgroup of $G$. Compute the number of Sylow 3-subgroups of $G$.

<em>Proof: </em> Clearly we have

$$
\begin{align*}
H&=\{\begin{bmatrix}
                1 & 0\\
                0 & 1
            \end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix}
                1 & 1\\
                0 & 1
            \end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix}
                1 & 2\\
                0 & 1
            \end{bmatrix}\}\\
            |H|&=3\\
            H&\subset G\subset \text{GL}_2(\mathbb{F}_3)
        \end{align*}
        $$

Hence, $3\mathrel{|}\lvert G\lvert$ and $|G|\mathrel{|}|\text{GL}_2(\mathbb{F}_3)|$. Using the formula derived in the [practice final](https://coolrmal.github.io/2024/12/23/Solutions-to-the-Practice-Final-for-MATH2510-Algebra,-Fall-2024,-Brown-University.html), we have

$$|\text{GL}_2(\mathbb{F}_3)|=(3^2-1)(3^2-3)=48=3\times 2^4$$

Therefore, the largest integer $m$ such that $3^m$ divides $\lvert G\rvert$ is $1$, which implies that $H$ is a Sylow 3-subgroup of $G$.

Now we compute the number $n$ of Sylow 3-subgroups. We first notice that the group of lower triangular matrices with all ones on the diagonal, denoted by $L$, is a subgroup of $G$. $L$ also contains 3 elements and is disjoint from $H$. Moreover, $\begin{bmatrix}
                2 & 0\\
                0 & 1
            \end{bmatrix}\notin G $, so we have the following estimates:

$$6\leq |G|<48$$

The only possible choices for $|G|$ are $3\times 2, 3\times 2^2, 3\times 2^3$. By the third Sylow theorem, $n\mathrel{|}\cfrac{|G|}{3}$. $n$ thus divides $8$, so the only possible choices for $|G|$ are $1,2,4,8$. The third Sylow theorem also says that $n\equiv 1\text{ (mod }3)$, which implies that $n$ is either equal to $1$ or $4$. Since $L$ is also a Sylow 3-subgroup, $n\geq 2$. We conclude that $n=4$.

<strong>Problem 3.</strong> VII.6.7. (Algebra: Chapter 0) Let $R$ be an integral domain and a nonzero element $a$. Give an example such that $a$ is irreducible but not prime.

<em>Proof: </em> Let $R=\cfrac{\mathbb{C}[x,y,z,w]}{(xy-zw)}$. $x+(xy-zw)$ is irreducible. The ideal generated by $x+(xy-zw)$ in $R$ contains $zw+(xy-zw)=xy+(xy-zw)$, but it does not contain $z+(xy-zw)$ and $w+(xy-zw)$, which means that $x+(xy-zw)$ is not prime. $\square$

<strong>Problem 4.</strong>  Prove that every nonzero commutative ring contains at least one maximal ideal.

<em>Proof: </em> This is just a classical application of Zorn's lemma. $\square$

<strong>Problem 5.</strong> Prove that a right adjoint functor preserves monomorphisms.

<em>Proof: </em> Given two functors $F:\mathcal{C}\rightarrow \mathcal{D}$ and $G:\mathcal{D}\rightarrow \mathcal{C}$. If $G$ is right adjoint to $F$, then we have the following bijection:

$$\hom_{\mathcal{D}}(FX,Y)\overset{I_{X,Y}}{\cong} \hom_{\mathcal{C}}(X,GY)$$

for all objects $X$ in $\mathcal{C}$ and $Y$ in $\mathcal{D}$. Moreover, the following commutative diagram commutes: 


$\square$

<strong>Problem 6.</strong> Let $n\geq 1$, and suppose $A:\mathbb{C}^n\to \mathbb{C}^n$ is an idempotent linear operator.  ({\em Idempotent} means that $A^2 = A$.)  What are the possibilities for the characteristic polynomial of $A$? 

<em>Proof: </em> Suppose $\lambda$ is an eigenvalue and $v$ is its corresponding eigenvector. Then

$$\lambda v=Av=A^2v=\lambda^2v\Rightarrow \lambda-\lambda^2=0$$

Therefore, $\lambda$ is either equal to $1$ or 0 and the characteristic polynomial takes the following form:

$$x^r(x-1)^{n-r}$$

for some $0\leq r\leq n$. $\square$

<strong>Problem 7.</strong> Let $k$ be a field. Prove that if all irreducible polynomials in $k[x]$ are separable, then $k$ is perfect.

<em>Proof: </em> We prove by contrapositive. Suppose $k$ is not perfect. Then char is nonzero and the Frobenius homomorphism is not surjective. We pick $u\in k$ that does not belong to the image $i$ of the Frobenius homomorphism. We claim that $x^p-u$ is an inseparable irreducible polynomial. It is not separable because in $\bar{k}$, if $v$ is a root to this polynomial, then $x^p-u=x^p-v^p=(x-v)^p$, which implies that $v$ is the only root with multiplicity $p$. $x^p-u$ is irreducible because if we have a nontrivial monic factor, it must be in the form $(x-v)^n=x^n-v^n$ for some $0<n<p$. Consequently, $v^n\in k$. $n$ and $p$ are relatively prime, so for some integer $a,b$ we have $na+pb=1$. Hence, 

$$v=v^{na+pb}=(v^{n})^au^b\in k$$

which is a contradiction. $\square$
