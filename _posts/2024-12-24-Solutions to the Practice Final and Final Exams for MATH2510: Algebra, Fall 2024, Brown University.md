## Solutions to the Practice Final and Final Exams for MATH2510: Algebra, Fall 2024, Brown University

This class has been quite enjoyable, as we have explored some interesting problems in algebra. In this post, I will present solutions to the Practice Final and Final exams.

<strong>Practice Final: </strong>

1. VII.6.4. (Algebra: Chapter 0) Let $k\subset E$ be a finite separable extension. Prove that $E$ may be identified with an intermediate field of a Galois extension $k\subset F$ of $k$. In fact, prove that there is a smallest such extension $k\subset F$, in the sense that if $k\subset E\subset K$, with $k\subset K$ Galois, then there exists an embedding of $F$ in $K$ which is the identity on $E$. (The extension $k\subset F$ is the Galois closure of the extension $k\subset E$.)

<em>Proof: </em> Since every finite separable extension is simple, $E=k(\alpha)$. Let $g$ be the minimal polynomial of $\alpha$. $g$ is separable. Let $k\subset F$ be the splitting field of $g$. $k\subset F$ is then a Galois extension, and $E$ is clearly an intermediate field of $F$.

We claim that $F$ is also the Galois closure. Suppose $k\subset E\subset K$ for some Galois extension $k\subset K$. $k\subset K$ is the a normal extension. Since $g$ has a root in $E\subset K$, $g$ splits in $K$. $K$ thus contains the splitting field $F$.
